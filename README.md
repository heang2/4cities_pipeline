In this repo, we built a workflow from OD prediction to traffic assignment, and then to urban congestion analysis and accessibility analysis in different [SSP scenario](https://github.com/usutradhar/Population-Trend-Analysis).The workflow can be divided into four stages: 1. LOSED7 raw data processing 2. Time series model prediction of OD flow data 3. Traffic allocation 4. ArcGIS urban congestion visualization and accessibility analysis.
